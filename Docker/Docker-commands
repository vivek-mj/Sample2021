yum install docker -y
docker --version
systemctl start docker
docker info (running or not)
docker stats (to check cpu usage, memory usage etc)
docker run -dit ubuntu (creates ubuntu container)
docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash (to login in to container and when exited container will be in running state)
docker attach container id ( to login to container but when exited the container will also be in exited (0) state i.e., in stopped state )
docker stop conatinerid ( to stop container. when we stop the container manually the exit code is 127 ) 
docker pause containerid

docker diff containerid ( to check the changes , added or deleted or changed files from outside without entering into the container )

**Commit a container with new configurations (--change) -- Example below **
docker inspect -f "{{ .Config.Env }}" containerid
docker commit --change "ENV DEBUG=true" containerid  svendowideit/testimage:version3
docker inspect -f "{{ .Config.Env }}" newimageid
**Commit a container with new CMD and EXPOSE instructions **
docker commit --change='CMD ["apachectl", "-DFOREGROUND"]' -c "EXPOSE 80" containerid  svendowideit/testimage:version4
docker run -d svendowideit/testimage:version4
docker ps
